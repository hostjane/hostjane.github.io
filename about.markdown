# What counts as a Service?

Services are paid Work tasks that stay within HostJane’s acceptable use policy (AUP) where the Seller is selling their Skill to a Buyer.

We welcome Sellers who are able to take the risks and costs of doing useful tasks for people on time.

The terms of each Service sold on HostJane must be written down in the Seller's Listing or Custom Offer prior to being purchased by the Buyer.
The Seller is promising they can do the Work task on time and 100% fulfill the delivery through HostJane’s order system which comprises a workspace of boards, lists and cards with chat.

So as a rule of thumb, you can sell your Service here if what you do for people can be:

- [x] Delivered in a non-physical, digital format
- [x] Done in one simple transaction
- [x] Delivered to the Buyer within 25 days from the date they pay you
- [x] Delivered on time
- [x] Able to keep the Buyer updated about your progress and;
- [x] Meets our AUP

# What is a skill?

On HostJane a “Skill" is your ability to do a useful Service, something that can be delivered "virtually" over the internet, that helps a Buyer because they cannot do the task without your help.

Sellers offer their skills in a number of different categories including:

- [x] Technology
- [x] Art
- [x] Voice
- [x] Design
- [x] Writing
- [x] Translation
- [x] Business
- [x] Online teaching / tutoring

Being able to build a website or fix someone’s computer remotely would be classed as skills here, as much as being able to teach a language over Skype or create custom artwork.

If you have a skill for doing something most people would consider useful, there’s a market for it here at HostJane.

# Who is a Buyer? 

A Buyer is any user who needs a Service. That can be anyone from a student seeking online lessons with a tutor to an entrepreneur creating software. 

All users must be over 18 years of age. 

# Who is a Seller?

A Seller is any user offering a Service based on their Skill.

If you are an incorporated business or intend to buy or sell over 20 orders per month, please sign up or convert your individual account to a business account.
We refuse to segregate Buyers and Sellers on HostJane. While Sellers see additional stats and sales analytics after posting at least 1 listing; the order center and reporting is integrated for every user to be a multi-player. We deliberately designed it that way.

Any user can seamlessly purchase services and enter confidentiality and licensing contracts with other users as easily as they sell their own Services and find new clients.

# Why are accounts integrated?

At HostJane, we believe work communities should avoid segregating people into different functions or tiered systems. For that same reason we also avoid badges, followers or levels that you might see on other marketplaces.

The only visible metric that might separate users here is the individual sales, or flame score and job completeness rating that are linked to client satisfaction if the user decides to sell Services.

Sellers also have a publicly available Studio while Buyer profiles can only be browsed by members for privacy.

# Who is HostJane for?

We can’t be great at everything, so we made HostJane for people who need useful tasks done fastly and affordably by someone who has the Skills they don’t.
As long as you are over 18 years old, you can buy and sell skills on HostJane's platform.

Whether it’s fixing a bug, editing a video, help with college assignments, building a mobile app or website for your business or interpreting in a foreign language, HostJane is the global resource community to help you prosper with your goals.

Being safe and private online is really important to us, which is why we provide a comprehensive review system to verify sellers, with every payment protected until the Buyer is satisfied they got their work.

Our hosting is aimed at business owners who need solid, fast and ‘always up’ VPS, delivered from up to 16 reliable global data centers, with the support of server professionals who have combined years of experience managing websites for small and mid-sized businesses.

# Where is HostJane based?

The HostJane development team operates as a distributed company with developers working remotely from home all over the world, very much like the freelance sellers trading their skills on the platform.

While some of the team reside in Australia, the company hosts web developers, designers and IT support professionals mainly from the U.S. (where web hosting support is served from) but also far-flung cities across Europe and India where systems engineers and software developers work remotely on the business.

# How old is HostJane?

HostJane was originally started in Queensland in 2017 by Tunde Reid-Kapo to build websites for local businesses and startups on Australia’s Gold Coast who didn’t have a website and couldn’t afford Aussie web designer prices.

On August 8, 2018 HostJane, Inc. was officially incorporated in Wyoming, U.S.

Around this time the company changed direction and began working on a marketplace with a better workspace to make HostJane a resource for people looking for skilled workers in addition to being a hosting company. Within 6 months, Australia entered a recession in early 2019 for the first time in 30 years.
When the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic swept the world the following year in 2020, HostJane’s marketplace platform was still in the middle of being developed as a resource for buyers and sellers.

The pandemic caused serious delays to HostJane's development.

COVID-19 also emphasized the urgency for an independent resource—not publicly-traded and beholden to profit-squeezing shareholders—that is focused solely on keeping money moving for struggling freelancers.

Three years after its incorporation and numerous delays, the marketplace at HostJane Skills eventually launched in October 2021.
HostJane helps businesses do smarter work.

Highlighted by HostJane's principles of payment protection, lower costs, simplicity, quality and variety; we connect freelancers to small and mid-sized companies to create new income streams from trading skills remotely.

# Who are the people behind HostJane?

HostJane is supported by Tunde Reid-Kapo who founded it to build websites for small businesses. In 2018, Tunde funded and helped to develop a server provisioning module with Blesta, an American software company in California; to provide security, speed and reliability for businesses deploying cloud computes on the Vultr platform.

# Why doesn't HostJane have an iOS or Android app?

Traditionally while web hosting companies have let third-parties publish and curate management apps for their computes or servers through iOS and Android, it’s often not part of the core service and those server managers often don’t officially involve the core development team. 

HostJane is no exception to that trend. HostJane will always be run like an early-stage startup with two linked businesses, web hosting and freelance marketplace platform. We are focused on developing our marketplace web app with a proprietary workspace for sellers and buyers to trade. Our marketplace web app syncs across all devices.

# What is HostJane's relationship with female equality?

From the beginning HostJane has held a long-term commitment to use the power of business to globally end gender discrimination in all its forms against women and girls which we think would make the world a better place for everyone else.

The company is committed to do our part by donating a portion of our profits to charities on the front line working to end violence against women and stopping gender discrimination.

# How do I become a Seller?

To add a Service at any time go to the Become a Seller page, review the general terms of service and acceptable use policy to make sure you agree and then choose a category to create your listing.

When your first listing is live, your profile which is viewable to members only will automatically be transitioned to a studio.
