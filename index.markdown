# We move work forwards

<span class="yellow">More of us are working from home, using remote workers to manage our business goals, and learning on webcams with tutors; people online in other countries not cities.</span>

### Better work outcomes

To better assist you plan, organize, and prioritize your work, tasks, and side projects, we built a team workspace with kanban-style boards, lists and cards, fitted inside a messaging app.

HostJane is [how we work remote](/getting-started/what-are-boards/#what-are-boards/) - to [keep money moving](https://www.hostjane.com/about).

![](/assets/board-view.png)

Hire freelancers with intelligent [payment protection](/getting-started/#payment-protection-guarantee), get more done and collaborate faster across time zones.

Get rid of:

- [x] Lengthy email threads
- [x] Disorganized chats
- [x] Annoying spreadsheets
- [x] Clunky software
- [x] Outdated hiring apps

<span class="green">HostJane is a fun and rewarding tool that fits in with you, helps you hire people, and host websites; a Swiss-Army Knife to push your ideas and actions from *to do* to **done**.</span>

### Better collaboration

Drag and drop cards in lists, cross between your chat with read receipts and board for better productivity; dive into details with shared attachments, comments and labels to track progress and time. 

Never drop the ball again with a summary of activity emailed to you and every board change tracked with an [audit trail](getting-started/what-are-boards/#board-activity) to keep you always up-to-date.
