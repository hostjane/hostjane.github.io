# How does 2-Step Authentication work?

Just like your bank verifies you authorized a transaction, you can activate two-factor authentication to double check it's you logging into your HostJane account.
To add a second layer of protection to your account, go to [Settings > Security](https://www.hostjane.com/marketplace/settings/security)

We'll send you a verification code each time you login to double check it's you.

# Why should I trust HostJane?

Buyers on HostJane are given a Purchase Protection guarantee so they can spend money with confidence on third-party Sellers without fear of loss.

If a Seller does not do what they said they were going to do on time and to a satisfactory standard our policy is to refund the Buyer.

HostJane has a fair [Disputes Resolution Center](https://www.hostjane.com/marketplace/disputes) inside the platform to ensure our policies are not abused by either party.

Anyone found to be abusing the satisfaction guarantee or our review system risks having their account permanently closed.

# How does HostJane encrypt data?

HostJane encrypts all sensitive data with AES-256.
HostJane does not process any credit card transaction on our platform or handle or store any payment data at any time. All payments are handled independently by our stringent PCI-compliant U.S.-located bank in a separate encrypted payment environment.

All card transactions must be verified by 3D Secure.

# How secure is HostJane?

HostJane has taken a number of steps to protect your data and payments, including offering two-factor authentication to all members.

If you believe your account has been compromised, please contact us and [change your password](https://www.hostjane.com/marketplace/settings/password) immediately. HostJane does not handle or store any payment data on our servers.

You can review the last 10 recent logins to your account in [Settings > Recent Activity](https://www.hostjane.com/marketplace/settings/activity).

# Can I sell physical products?

As a rule of thumb, if something can't be virtual delivered over the internet to the Buyer to complete an order, then it doesn't belong on HostJane.
Services that produce or manufacture a product that is required to be physically shipped and signed for by the Buyer (with a tracking mail carrier like FedEx) are not supported on HostJane because too much can go wrong.

HostJane supports sellers doing stuff that falls within the scope of our definition of a Skill and what counts as a Service.

# Do you process data requests?

HostJane takes privacy and intellectual property rights seriously and we are committed to adhering to our legal responsibilities.

If you wish to submit a DMCA copyright takedown request or counter notice, please follow the instructions given in Section 2.2 and 2.4 of our Acceptable Use Policy.

If you wish to delete your account, you can schedule the deletion of all data held about you on HostJane by accessing Settings > Close Account.

Account removal takes 1 month from the date of submission and this policy applies to all users, including people accessing HostJane from inside the European Economic Area (EEA) under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
