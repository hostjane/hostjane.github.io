# What do the check marks mean?

In messaging and order chats, check marks appear next to each message you send with the timestamp of sending. 

Here's what they mean:

### Single check

The message was successfully delivered to user

### Double check 

The recipient has read your message

For audit and transparency purposes, read receipts cannot be turned off.

# Can I hide my 'last seen'?

For audit and transparency purposes this is not currently possible.

# Can I delete my messages?

You can archive messages by using the Archive icon in the top right menu of [Messages](https://www.hostjane.com/marketplace/messages), which will remove the message from *All Conversations* view but for legal and audit reasons all conversations are stored and can't be permanetly deleted.
