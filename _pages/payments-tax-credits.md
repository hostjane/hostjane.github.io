## How to add a bank account for withdrawal?

To add a new bank account, login to HostJane and go to Settings > [Payouts](https://www.hostjane.com/marketplace/settings/payouts).

For U.S. sellers, select the Direct Deposit tab. You can enter your routing and account number with details which are free to receive.

For international sellers in these Supported Countries, select the Wire Transfer tab. You will need your SWIFT account details to register your bank account.

Note that HostJane cannot be held responsible for delays, extra costs or financial loss that arises from being provided incorrect account information, so please ensure that you double check the details with your financial institution prior to submitting a request for a Bank Transfer.

## How to find my routing and account number

If you want to be paid your earnings by Direct Deposit, you will need to provide an American account and routing number.

![](/assets/account-routing.png)

Your bank routing number is a nine-digit code that's based on the U.S. Bank location where your account was opened. It's the first set of numbers printed on the bottom of most checks, on the left side.

## Why do I have to wait 5 days for payments?

To meet our anti-fraud obligations, HostJane holds payments for 5 days after each order is completed with Buyer approval and compulsory feedback.

In [Reporting](https://www.hostjane.com/marketplace/reporting), we keep you informed of the clearance progress of your earnings in hours and minutes to go for each order.

Once the countdown reaches zero in the Payout Status column of Your Sales, those earnings become available for withdrawal to your payout method.
