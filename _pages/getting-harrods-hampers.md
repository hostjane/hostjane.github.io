## What are Harrods Hampers?

<span class="blue">Harrods Hampers are luxurious woven gift baskets, shipped to over 200 countries, filled with premium gourmet treats from the London store's renowned Food Halls—such as chocolates, preserves, and seasonal delicacies—designed as elegant presents for occasions like birthdays, holidays, or celebrations. Hampers are non-alcholic, exportable worldwide, and sent to your private address on file which is encrypted and secret.</span>

<span class="green">Buyers do not need a HostJane account to send Harrods Hampers and can do so anonymously.</span>

Note: Harrods has currently suspended deliveries to Turkey, Canary Islands, Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, Afghanistan, North Korea, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Niger and Somalia.

## How do I activate Harrods wishlist on my account?

<span class="yellow">When you [sign up free](https://www.hostjane.com) to HostJane, check the "Add Harrods Gift wishlist" box or if you are already a member, go to your [Settings](https://www.hostjane.com/marketplace/settings) area to check the box and activate wishlists on your freelancer or studio page. </span>

## Do I need to be selling a Service to accept Harrods Hampers?

<span class="red">You must be either a Seller with a valid Service or a Freelancer with a public business profile on HostJane to add a Harrods Gifts wishlist.</span>

## What Hampers are available?

All Harrods Hampers available through HostJane are physically exportable, shipped from Harrods in London by DHL, and dependent on seasonal availabilty.

## Is there a maximum for customizable Hampers?

Buyers can send up to $90,000 in a single Harrods gift purchase.

## What is the 100% credit option?

For multiple reasons, HostJane cannot ship Harrods Hampers to every single freelancer in every single country.

Sellers have the ability to opt to receive the physical Harrods Hamper sent to their physical address on record, where HostJane receives the gift funds, buys the item from Harrods for shipment to the Seller's address provided in Settings, or to buy the Harrods Hamper themselves.

<span class="green">In these instances the Seller or Freelancer will receive the gift funds directly once a gift is bought, added to their HostJane Balance. The Seller can then withdraw the balance to a withdrawal method of their choice and use the credit to purchase the Harrods Hamper for themselves after an expedited fourty-eight (48) hour clearance period. You can withdraw your balance [here](https://www.hostjane.com/marketplace/settings/payouts)!<span>

There are no fees for receiving Harrods Hamper gifts.

Example: Jody is a Freelancer with a public business profile on HostJane. An anonymous User gifts her a customizable <a href="https://www.hostjane.com/legal/marketplace-terms/">Harrods Food Hall Hamper</a> for $20. Jody opts to receive a direct credit. Jody pays no fees, receives $20 within 48 hours to buy the item from Harrods herself.

| Breakdown       | Jody Receives       | Anon Pays |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------|
| Gift           | Harrods Hamper | $20  |
| Handling fee | $0   | $3.49  |
| Card fee           | $0      | (5.5%) $1.1  |
| Totals           | $20 | $24.59  |

## How long does it take to get my direct credit?
