# Introduction to Earnings

<span class="green">The standard Seller Earnings rate is 95% on all Listings, Online Lessons, Custom Offers and Tips. The total price of each Service is set and controlled by each Seller.</span>

<span class="blue">HostJane pays all overhead costs from the 5% Marketplace Fee.</span>

Please [contact us](https://www.hostjane.com/marketplace/contact) if you have any questions.

## Summary for Earning on HostJane

* Each Seller sets the price of their own Services

* Sellers receive the full 95% from each sale

* There is a 5-day waiting period before you can withdraw earned funds from completed orders to prevent fraud and other problems

* We can pay you out by any method listed in your Settings > Payouts

<span class="green">We follow the [HostJane Roadmap](/buyers/hostjane-roadmap/)</span>

### Policies

<span class="yellow">After a Seller has published 1 listing, a sales snapshot is available in account dashboard, tracking daily sales, payouts, cleared and unsettled or pending earnings.</span>

Use the Set Your Price calculator when creating or editing your listing to calculate how much your Buyer will pay and how much you will earn on each order.

### The Base Price is made up of:

* **Service Cost**: You set this price to cover the cost of your Work. It should include your 95% seller percentage and the 5% Marketplace Fee that HostJane bills per order.

* **Handling Fee**: The $1.99 non-refundable fee that Buyers pay HostJane irregardless of the total price of the transaction to support our running costs.

### The Base Price does not include:

* **Licensing Cost**: If you sell commercial use of your Work to Buyers with a license, the Buyer will pay for this cost on top of the Base Price. 
Added Extras: If you sell optional Services or add-ons to your Buyer, these are charged as added extras on top of the Base Price.

* **Confidentiality**: If the Buyer wishes for you to sign HostJane's standard NDA agreement, when you accept their order, they will pay an administrative fee to HostJane that is charged on top of the Base price. Sellers on HostJane control which orders they accept and refuse without penalty.

Let's see an example with a $100 Service:

![](/assets/calculator.png)

The Seller uses the left box to enter a Service Cost of $100. 

- [x] The Base price is the Service Cost added to the Handling Fee
- [x] The Handling fee is $1.99
- [x] Buyer will pay $101.99 for the Service Cost, the Handling Fee and any card fees
- [x] HostJane's Marketplace Fee is 5% of the Service Cost.

<span class="green">Putting it all together:</span>

Seller's Earnings = Service Cost - Marketplace Fee
= ($100) - (5% x $100)
= $100 - $5
= $95 USD

**So in this case, the Seller earned $95 USD**

- There is a 5-day waiting period after the order is completed before the Seller can withdraw those funds to their bank account.
- There is no minimum amount for withdrawal
- As you are an independent contractor, HostJane does not apply withholding tax or any other form of tax or fee.
- Ensure you complete any tax forms on your account, HostJane will notify you when and how you need to do this.

In Online Lessons, Sellers can set a different Service Cost for each standard block of lesson time (30, 45 and 60 minutes) and a trial lesson cost and duration.
