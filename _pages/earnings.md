# How It Works

<span class="orange">Service prices are calculated from a Base Price set by each Seller.</span>
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

<span class="blue">Use the calculator when creating a listing to see how much you will earn, and how much your Buyers will pay, for each order.</span>
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

![](/assets/calculator-clear.png)

<span class="yellow">**Base Price** is the **Service Cost** added to the **Handling Fee**.</span>
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

# Base Price is made up of:
{: .no_toc }

- [x] **Service Cost**: You set this price to cover the cost of your Work. It should include your 95% seller percentage and the 5% Marketplace Fee that HostJane bills per order.
- [x] **Handling Fee**: The $1.99 non-refundable fee that Buyers pay HostJane irregardless of the total price of the transaction to support site running costs.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

# Base Price does not include:
{: .no_toc }

- [x] **Licensing Cost**: If you sell commercial use of your Work to Buyers with a license, the Buyer will pay for this cost on top of the Base Price. 
- [x] **Added Extras**: If you sell optional Services or add-ons to your Buyer, these are charged as added extras on top of the Base Price.
- [x] **Confidentiality**: If the Buyer wishes for you to sign HostJane's standard NDA agreement, when you accept their order, they will pay an administrative fee charged on top of the Base price.

# $100 Example With Breakdown

In this example, a Seller prices their Service at $100 using the listing calculator, which is available when any Seller creates a new listing or booking.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

![](/assets/calculator.png)

- [x] HostJane's Marketplace Fee is 5% of the Service Cost.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

<span class="green">Here's the math on $100:</span>
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

- [x] Earnings = Service Cost - Marketplace Fee
- [x] = ($100) - (5% x $100)
- [x] = $100 - $5
- [x] = $95 USD
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

<span class="purple">On $100, a Buyer pays $101.99 + card fees</span>
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

- [x] The **Handling fee** is a non-refundable charge of $1.99 to help cover site costs
- [x] Buyer will pay $101.99 for the Service Cost, the Handling Fee and any card fees
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

- [x] There is a 5-day waiting period after the order is completed before the Seller can withdraw those funds to their bank account.
- [x] As Sellers are independent contractors, and not employees, HostJane does not apply withholding tax or any other form of tax or fee.
- [x] Ensure you complete any tax forms on your account, HostJane will notify you when and how you need to do this.
