# How to add an hourly rate?

If you have added a Service on HostJane, you can advertise your freelance services as an hourly rate in Studios and Listings. You can make custom offers to Buyers which become custom orders.

After adding a Service, go to [Settings](https://www.hostjane.com/marketplace/settings) and activate the hourly rate box by entering your dollar rate. Press 'Update Studio' to save. 

![](/assets/enter.png)

The hourly rate will then appear on your Studios for Buyers who contact you for a free quote.

The advantages of selling with an hourly rate include:

* Helps Buyers understand how you price your Services
* It's easier to sell time slots to Buyers over upfront fees
* You can make a custom offer to Buyers based on your hourly rate
* Doesn't stop you selling fixed-price Services

# My images or uploaded content is not loading

HostJane uses Backblaze which on rare occasion may load a 5xx error on uploaded user content causing an error message in browsers.

{% highlight yaml %}
{ "code": "internal_error", "message": "internal incident", "status": 500 }
{% endhighlight %}

The error is rare and will usually resolve within 24-72 hours or the source file may show and disappear intermittently depending on Backblaze's engineering fix time.

If the error is recurrent, affecting your profile or studio avatar or an important image or file in your listing, we suggest you upload a replacement file.

* Update listing images and files in Dashboard > [Listing Center](https://www.hostjane.com/marketplace/listings)

* Update profile/studio images to Dashboard > [Settings](https://www.hostjane.com/marketplace/settings)

# Can I decline orders?

Yes, you're free to decline and mutually cancel unlimited orders with no penalties to your account.
We want Sellers only to accept jobs they can finish in good time.

![](/assets/accept.png)

When you're sent a new order, an accept/decline screen will appear with a Sales Invoice, itemized payment breakdown and your forecast net earnings for the order.

![](/assets/declined.png)

If you click 'decline', the Buyer is refunded the cost of the Service minus the handling fee for the transaction.

# How do I pause my listing?

If you will be away for a time, you can pause and resume your listing by these 3 methods:

* By taking a break if you do not have any active orders

# Can my business open a HostJane account?

Yes, Sellers can register on HostJane as agencies or business entities, as well individual freelancers who are doing a larger amount of business through the site.

You can select the following business structures for your account

* Sole proprietorship
* Limited Liability Company (LLC)
* Corporation
* Non-Profit
* Partnership or other

We generally verify people not businesses on HostJane but we will contact you individually should we need your business documents, company formation or tax ID numbers for administrative purposes.

# Only accept payment through HostJane

HostJane is not a directory or portfolio site. To succeed in a difficult space as a new marketplace we need Sellers to honor their pledge in 3.1.6 of the Marketplace Rules to only accept payments through us for Services offered on our platform.

Your account can be suspended of you conduct HostJane business outside HostJane.

# Can I use copyrighted work in my Service?

The purpose of HostJane is for Buyers to find original Work from talented freelancers without a middle-man agency ripping off freelancers. We therefore encourage Sellers to only use their own copyright in listings.

If you expressly need to use someone else's copyright in your listing, for example, in Stock Photographs, you will need to obtain permission or a use license from the copyright holder and you must credit the source. 

This is especially important if a model release applies.

If you use any part of a third-party copyright holder's material in Work that you deliver to a Buyer, you must tell the Buyer exactly which parts of the Work this effects as a split license may apply.

You cannot use pictures of anyone under the age of 18 years of age anywhere on HostJane.

# Can I take subscriptions?

No, HostJane only allows single purchases of original, on-demand Work, including online lessons, from Sellers on a per-order basis.

Funds can be transferred as one-off payments via:

- [x] Listings
- [x] Lessons
- [x] Tips
- [x] Custom orders

# Subcontracting policy

You're free use subcontractors to fulfil Services on HostJane so long as you meet these requirements:

* You have a legal arrangement to resell Work from your subcontractor

* Any stock photography used in Final Work meets our copyright requirements

* Your subcontractor can promptly deliver Work within the delivery timeframes given to Buyers in your listing

# How do I increase my sales?

Promote your account by placing your HostJane studio link in the "About" fields of your blog and social profiles, share posts via Twitter, and advertise your HostJane Listings anywhere you freelance or have followers online.

Your studio link to HostJane is HostJane.com/marketplace/Username

Other ways to promote your Listings:

- [x] Ask customers to review their experiences with you on their blogs and social media accounts;
- [x] Maintain accurate, up-to-date Listings;
- [x] Add new FAQs and review/improve your listing content monthly adding new testimonials, features and promotions;
- [x] Respond to messages from potential buyers promptly

# Can I offer downloads?

Yes, although you will need to send your buyers the download manually. As a marketplace focused on on-demand Work, we don't offer any automated way to sell downloads or API to check on downloaded software usage.
