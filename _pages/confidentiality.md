# What are confidentiality or NDA agreements?

<span class="green">An NDA or Non Disclosure Agreement is a legal contract between you and a Seller that ensures they cannot talk about or share any content about your project with anyone.</span>

NDAs help people keep their Work private in the beginning stages of projects.

Watch attorney Brett Cenkus provide a good overview of what NDAs mean and why they are important to protect your confidential info.
