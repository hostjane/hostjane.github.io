As part of 2.1.2 of our [Marketplace terms](https://www.hostjane.com/legal/marketplace-terms/), you will receive your full money-back paid on a Service less the non-refundable Handling Fee:

# Securing your account

<span class="yellow">From October 1, 2024, two-factor authentication (2FA) by email, will be mandatory for all users on HostJane and will not be able to be disabled.</span>

![](/assets/2fa-1.png)

<span class="green">Each time you login, HostJane will send a code to your email to ask you to verify your login device. The code expires in 2 mins, so you will need to have immediate access to your email to receive it.</span>

# Verifying your identity

It's a good idea to verify your identity if you're a seller, to increase Buyer's trust in your service. 

<span class="blue">Sometimes we'll ask you to verify your identity.</span>

Navigate to Listings Center and click Get verified to begin the process.

 To confirm your identity, you’ll need to submit a photo of your government ID. 
 
 This could be a driver’s licence, passport, identity card or visa document.

We'll also ask you to confirm that the person in the Government ID is you by uploading a recent selfie of yourself.

All your listings will be paused when take a break mode ends. You will need to manually resume each listing one by one.
