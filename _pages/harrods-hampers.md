## What will show on my card statement?

HOSTJANE or HOSTJANE.COM will appear on your statement.

<span class="green">All funds are billed and sent in U.S. dollars only.</span>

## Do I need to open a HostJane account to buy from a Seller's Harrods wishlist?

No, you can gift Harrods Hampers to any freelancer on HostJane by using the guest checkout. We will still send you a receipt to your email, if you provide one.

## Can I leave a comment with my gift?

<span class="blue">There is a 5.5% fee plus a $3.49 handling fee per gift box.<span>

Example: Jane is a visitor. She wants to gift Ian, a Freelancer with a public business profile on HostJane, a customizable <a href="https://www.hostjane.com/legal/marketplace-terms/">Harrods Food Hall Hamper</a> toward his grocery living costs. This special thank you will assist his mental health well-being and recognize his human value. Ian opts to receive a direct credit. Jody pays no fees, receives $10 within 48 hours to buy the item from Harrods herself.

| Breakdown       | Janes Pays       | Ian Receives |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------|
| Gift           | $10 | Harrods Hamper  |
| Handling fee | $3.49   | $0  |
| Credit card fee (5.5%)           | $0.55      | $0  |
| Totals           | $14.04 | $10  |

## How long does it take for the User to get my gift box?

<span class="yellow">Physical delivery of Harrods Hampers may be delayed due to situations beyond our control, for example adverse weather conditions or increase in demand. If your Seller opts to receive a direct credit to buy the Hamper themself, we will credit 100% of the Hamper cost <strong>within 48 hours</strong> to the User's HostJane Balance.</span>

<span class="purple">If you are a Seller or Freelancer, withdrawal methods depend on your location. Login to your Account > [Settings > Payouts](https://www.hostjane.com/marketplace/settings/payouts) to view available payout methods in your country together with timing and requirements for payouts.</span>

## How are tips different from wishlist gifts?

Harrods Hampers are physical gifts to assist Sellers and Freelancers meet their human living costs. 100% of the Hamper is shipped or credited to the freelancer within 48 hours.

Tips are assumed to be given for Work done in a service or lesson on HostJane. They are paid at 95% and the 5-day waiting period applies.

## Are wishlist sales final?

<span class="blue">Yes. As per the official [Harrods Returns policy](https://www.harrods.com/en-us/c/faqs/hampers), Harrods Hampers and gift boxes purchased in-store or online are non-refundable. By sending a freelancer a non-refundable Harrods Hamper, you agree you are sending a non-refundable gift and not expecting any product or service from the User in return.</span>
