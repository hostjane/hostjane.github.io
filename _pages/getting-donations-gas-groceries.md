## Why Donations for Gas & Groceries?

<span class="blue">Gas & food are basic human needs. To help people who freelance online make ends meet in the global living crisis, HostJane takes 0% fees, and pays out 100% on donated gas & groceries.</span>

<span class="green">Buyers do not need a HostJane account to send you donations and can do so anonymously.</span>

HostJane is also completely free to use. 

## How do I activate donations on my account?
