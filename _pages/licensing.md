# How licensing works

<span class="yellow">Licenses are legal agreements that tell you what you can and can't do with the Final Work that a Seller creates for you on HostJane - and who legally owns that work.</span>

Licenses do not apply to online lessons.

Example: You're a business in New York and your seller is a software developer in Germany: Two completely different countries with different laws. 

With HostJane licensing, the Seller can let you buy their Service under a license which tells both of you:

- [x] Who owns the Intellectual Property (IP) you of the Work the Seller creates for you
- [x] What you can do with the Work
- [x] Who you can distribute the Work to
- [x] Where you can sell or trade the Work
- [x] How you can use the Work online and offline
- [x] If you need to give the Seller a credit
- [x] How any disputes related to the Work will be resolved

A license takes the guesswork out of buying Services from people in your own and foreign countries.

There are 4 types of Licenses a Seller can work under for you on HostJane:

### Buyer Owns Rights (Free)

All rights and title in Work created by the Seller are transferred to the Buyer after release of payment.

### Personal (Paid)

Buyer can only use the Work in non-commercial projects. Great for personal projects.

### Limited (Paid)

Buyer can use the Work in 1 commercial service or project with limited end use. Seller must be credited.

### Unlimited (Paid)

Buyer is granted full rights and title in the Work when they release payment to Buyer. Seller credit not required.

If you and the Seller do not agree a License then under 2.15 of the Marketplace Rules, all rights and title in the Work is transferred to the Buyer when they release payment to the Seller and leave a review in an order.
