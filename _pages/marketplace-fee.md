# Marketplace Fees

<span class="blue">Note: Please also see [Introduction to Earnings](/sellers/earnings/) for sellers.</span>

HostJane is completely free to use. 

<span class="green">No setup, subscription or hidden fees to sell a Service on HostJane with your Skill.<span>

<span class="yellow">There are no fees on donations which are paid out at 100% within 48 hours to your nominated bank or PayPal account</span>

We strive to be a safe, secure environment which protects both sellers and buyers.

To operate our platform and provide marketing, hosting and payment services to Buyers and Sellers, we charge a Marketplace Fee on finalized sales of Services after Buyer approval and on tips.

### Current Marketplace Fee

{% highlight yaml %}
- Does not apply to donations for gas and groceries
- 5% on the Service Cost of Listings (Regular and Online Lessons)
- 5% on Service Cost of Custom Orders
- 5% on Tips.
{% endhighlight %}

Sellers retain a guaranteed 95% on all Sales including listings, custom orders and tips, because HostJane pays all credit card processing and bank fees.

Example: Alison is a PHP geek. Her listing offers a bug fixing service at $100 per order. Bill is her first Buyer. Alison pays no fees, and makes $95 coding on Bill's site.
