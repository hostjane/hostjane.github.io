Example: Jane is a visitor. She wants to do Ian, a Freelancer with a public business profile on HostJane, by donating toward his grocery living costs as an <a href="https://www.hostjane.com/legal/marketplace-terms/">Act of Kindness</a>. This is for the charitable purpose to assist his mental health well-being and recognize his human value. Ian pays no fees, and will receive the full $10 within 48 hours.

| Breakdown       | Janes Pays       | Ian Receives |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------|
| Donation           | $10 | Groceries  |
| Handling fee | $1.99   | $0  |
| Credit card fee (5.5%)           | $0.55      | $0  |
| Totals           | $12.54 | $10  |

## How long does it take for the Seller or Freelancer to get my donation?

<span class="yellow">HostJane will send 100% of your donation <strong>within 48 hours</strong> to the User's payout method.</span>

## What countries are supported?

<span class="blue">PayPal may not be available in all of the countries that HostJane sends free international bank transfers in USD.</span>

## How are tips different from donations?

Donations are only for food and gas to assist Sellers and Freelancers meet their human living costs. 100% of you donation is paid to the freelancer within 48 hours.

Tips are assumed to be given for Work done in a service or lesson on HostJane. They are paid at 95% and the 5-day waiting period applies.

## Are donations final?

<span class="blue">Yes. By sending a freelancer a non-refundable donation for a Freelancer or Seller's gas or groceries, you are not expecting to receive any service from the User as you are considered to be doing an "<a href="https://www.hostjane.com/legal/marketplace-terms/">Act of Kindness</a>" for that User.</span>
