# How revisions work

You will have the number of revisions that you agree with the Seller before the order starts. 

Inside the order page, click on the 'Delivered Files' link to see each revision sent by the Seller.

You will see a list of all the files delivered by the Seller, with a timestamp and revision number for each file.

When a Seller delivers your order, you can accept or decline each revision the number of agreed times.

You can then give your Seller instructions for what you want changed.

Payment is not released to the Seller until you are satisfied with their Work. Sellers must send you a Work Preview which can be a preview, watermarked or abridged version of the Final Work.

In Web/Mobile/Tech, a Work Preview can be a preview of the finished website or software on a staging server.

Before you receive the Final Work, you will need to review your Seller.

If you have any problems after delivery, you can open a dispute.
